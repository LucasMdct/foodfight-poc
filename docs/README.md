# Documentation

Everything written about Food Fight, indexed. Start here.

The project has two eras: the **POC** that validated React Native Skia, and the **game** (v0.0.1) that replaced it. Docs describe the game unless they say otherwise.

## Core documents

| Document | What it covers | Read time |
|---|---|---|
| [architecture.md](./architecture.md) | How the game is built and why each decision was made | 20 min |
| [testing.md](./testing.md) | The validation protocol — not yet run against v0.0.1 | 12 min |
| [troubleshooting.md](./troubleshooting.md) | Symptom → cause → fix | reference |
| [results.md](./results.md) | POC measurements and findings — historical baseline | 8 min |

Project entry point and quick start live in the [root README](../README.md). Version history is in the [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md).

## Design

[`design/`](./design/) holds the design handoff bundle — HTML prototypes, the style guide, and character geometry.

**It is the source of truth for shapes and colours**, not the code. `src/render/foodie/characters/*` port coordinates verbatim from `design/project/Foodie.dc.html`; visual changes start there and are ported, never the other way round.

## Specs

Written before implementation, one per feature.

| Spec | Subject |
|---|---|
| [2026-07-05-foodfight-v001-design.md](./specs/2026-07-05-foodfight-v001-design.md) | **v0.0.1 game design** — heroes, villain, screens, theme |
| [poc-runner-skia.md](./specs/poc-runner-skia.md) | The original POC specification and acceptance criteria |
| [2026-07-04-play-again-button.md](./specs/2026-07-04-play-again-button.md) | Game Over modal and replay flow |
| [2026-07-04-orientation.md](./specs/2026-07-04-orientation.md) | Orientation selection *(superseded — v0.0.1 locks landscape)* |
| [2026-07-04-dopamine-loader.md](./specs/2026-07-04-dopamine-loader.md) | POC loading screen *(superseded by the themed loader)* |

## Plans

Step-by-step implementation plans derived from the specs above.

| Plan | Subject |
|---|---|
| [2026-07-05-foodfight-v001.md](./plans/2026-07-05-foodfight-v001.md) | **v0.0.1 game implementation** |
| [2026-07-04-play-again-button.md](./plans/2026-07-04-play-again-button.md) | Game Over modal (POC) |
| [2026-07-04-dopamine-loader.md](./plans/2026-07-04-dopamine-loader.md) | Loading screen (POC) |

## Where to go

**Running it for the first time** → [root README → Quick start](../README.md#quick-start)

**Changing gameplay code** → [architecture.md](./architecture.md) first. The frame loop has two invariants that are easy to break silently: no per-frame React state, and no allocation inside the worklet.

**Changing how something looks** → [`design/`](./design/) first, then port.

**Testing on a device** → [testing.md](./testing.md). v0.0.1 has never been measured on hardware; that is the largest open item on the project.

**Something is broken** → [troubleshooting.md](./troubleshooting.md)

**Wondering why the stack is what it is** → [results.md](./results.md)

---

## Archive

[`archive/`](./archive/) holds the seven superseded documents from the pre-restructure layout. They contain **inaccurate descriptions of the codebase** and are kept only for historical reference. Do not use them as a guide.

---

## Conventions

- Docs are written in English. Technical terms stay in their original form (worklet, hitbox, frame budget).
- Specs and plans are prefixed with their date: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`.
- Every user-visible change gets a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `[Unreleased]` before release.
- When code and docs disagree, the code is right and the doc is a bug.

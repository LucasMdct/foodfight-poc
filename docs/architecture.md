# Architecture

How Food Fight is built, and why it is built this way.

**Scope:** this describes the code as it exists on `feature/v001`. It covers the v0.0.1 game. The POC that preceded it is documented in [results.md](./results.md).

---

## The central constraint

A 60 fps target gives a **16.67 ms budget per frame**. In React Native, the JS thread is the wrong place to spend that budget: every `setState` schedules a React render, reconciliation, and a bridge hop. At 60 fps that is 60 render passes per second for values that change continuously.

The whole architecture follows from avoiding that:

> **Per-frame values never touch React.** They live in Reanimated shared values, are mutated by a worklet on the UI thread, and are read directly by Skia. React only hears about discrete events — a hit, a score change, one FPS sample per second, a screen transition.

Everything below is a consequence of this rule. It carried over from the POC unchanged, and it is the one part of the codebase that should not be casually refactored.

## Layers

```
App.tsx  ─ font loading, landscape lock, loading gate
   │
   ├─ ThemeProvider              design tokens + UI scaling
   └─ Flow
        ├─ LoadingScreen         until fonts are ready
        ├─ SelectScreen          screen === 'select'
        └─ GameScreen            screen === 'game' | 'over'
             │
             ├─ useRunnerEngine(width, height)   ← all gameplay lives here
             │     └─ useFrameCallback worklet (UI thread)
             │           ├─ FPS sampling
             │           ├─ tablecloth scroll
             │           ├─ difficulty ramp
             │           ├─ candy spawn
             │           ├─ candy movement + recycling
             │           ├─ AABB collision
             │           └─ invulnerability flicker
             │
             ├─ SwipeHandler      Fling gestures → engine.moveLane()
             ├─ Canvas            Skia scene: tablecloth, lanes, villain, candies, hero
             ├─ Hud               lives, score, hero name, exit, control hint
             └─ GameOverModal     screen === 'over'
                      │
                      └─ useGameStore (Zustand)  discrete state only
```

**Data flow is one-directional per thread:**

- UI thread: worklet writes shared values → Skia reads them → pixels. No React involved.
- JS thread: worklet calls `runOnJS` on discrete events → Zustand updates → HUD re-renders.

---

## Screen flow — `App.tsx` and `gameStore`

```
LoadingScreen ──fonts loaded + intro done──▶ SelectScreen
SelectScreen  ──pick(who) + start()───────▶ GameScreen (screen: 'game')
GameScreen    ──lives reach 0────────────▶ GameOverModal (screen: 'over')
                                            ├─ play again → screen: 'game'
                                            └─ switch hero → screen: 'select'
```

`GameScreen` renders for **both** `'game'` and `'over'` — the modal draws on top of a frozen scene rather than replacing it. That means "play again" re-enters `'game'` without a remount, and the engine's shared values survive. `GameScreen` therefore calls `engine.reset()` in an effect keyed on `screen === 'game'`, which covers the first mount and every restart through one code path.

Orientation is locked to landscape once, in `App.tsx`. There is no orientation selection screen — that was a POC artifact.

---

## The engine — `src/hooks/useRunnerEngine.ts`

One hook holds the entire game loop. There is no `systems/` directory: splitting the loop into modules would mean crossing the worklet boundary or allocating per frame.

### Shared values

Created once with `makeMutable` and memoised so they survive re-renders:

| Value | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `heroLane` | 0, 1, 2 — current lane index |
| `heroY` | Animated top-Y of the hero |
| `heroOpacity` | Drives the invulnerability flicker |
| `invulnUntil` | Game-clock timestamp when invulnerability ends |
| `elapsedTime` | Monotonic game clock, survives re-renders |
| `lastUpdateTime` | Frame timestamp of the last accepted update |
| `scrollX` | Tablecloth scroll offset, 0 to −88 |
| `candySpin` | One shared spin phase for every candy |
| `obstacleX[]`, `obstacleY[]`, `obstacleLane[]`, `obstacleActive[]` | Per-slot candy state |
| `spawnAccum`, `fpsAccum`, `fpsFrames` | Accumulators |
| `gameOver` | 1 freezes the simulation |

### The candy pool

`OBSTACLE_MAX_ACTIVE` (8) is a **pool size, not a cap**. Eight candy `<Group>`s are mounted once by `GameScreen` and never unmounted. Spawning means finding a slot with `obstacleActive === 0` and setting its position; despawning means setting it back to 0.

`obstacleActive` doubles as the group's `opacity`, so hiding is free — no conditional rendering, no key churn, no React reconciliation.

**Candy type is not tracked by the engine.** Slot `i` is always `['lolli','candy','donut'][i % 3]`, so `GameScreen` derives it from the index. Carrying it as state would cost a shared value or a re-render to communicate a constant.

**All candies share one spin animation.** `candySpin` is a single `useSpin(900)` phase passed to every slot, rather than eight independent `withRepeat` animations. Visually they rotate in lockstep, which matches the mockup.

**Consequence:** zero allocation per frame, and therefore no GC pressure from the loop. This is what kept memory flat through the POC's stress testing.

**Trade-off:** if all 8 slots are busy, a spawn tick is silently skipped. The difficulty ramp shortens the spawn interval over time, which narrows the margin — worth re-checking if the ramp constants change.

### The frame loop

```
useFrameCallback(frame):
  1. bootstrap lastUpdateTime on the first frame
  2. elapsed = frame.timestamp - lastUpdateTime
  3. if elapsed < 16.0ms → return          ← throttle
  4. advance elapsedTime by the real delta
  5. FPS: count frames, emit one sample per second via runOnJS
  6. if gameOver → return                   ← freezes everything below
  7. tablecloth scroll: 88px loop every 900ms
  8. difficulty ramp: derive current speed and spawn interval from elapsed time
  9. spawn: on interval, activate one idle slot in a random lane
 10. for each active candy:
       move left by speed * dt
       off-screen? → deactivate, +10 score
       same lane as hero and not invulnerable? → AABB test on X
 11. flicker: derive heroOpacity from time remaining on invulnUntil
```

Details worth knowing before touching this:

**The 16.0 ms throttle (step 3).** `useFrameCallback` fires at the display refresh rate, which is 90 Hz or 120 Hz on many devices. Without the throttle, gameplay would run proportionally faster on those screens. The threshold is 16.0 and not 16.67 so that ordinary timing jitter does not cause a frame to be skipped entirely, which produced visible stutter. Movement still uses the real measured delta, so the simulation stays correct either way.

**The game-over gate (step 6) freezes the scene, not just gameplay.** Scroll and spawn both sit below it, so the Game Over modal draws over a still tablecloth. FPS sampling sits above it and keeps running.

**The difficulty ramp (step 8)** is derived from `elapsedTime` every frame rather than stored:

```
speed    = CANDY_BASE_SPEED + min(CANDY_SPEED_RAMP_MAX, now * CANDY_SPEED_RAMP_RATE)
interval = max(SPAWN_INTERVAL_MIN, SPAWN_INTERVAL - now * SPAWN_INTERVAL_RAMP_RATE)
```

Candies accelerate from 340 px/s toward a 600 px/s ceiling, and the spawn interval tightens from 900 ms toward a 420 ms floor. Because both are pure functions of the clock, `engine.reset()` resetting `elapsedTime` is enough to restore starting difficulty — there is no separate difficulty state to forget.

**The collision test only checks X (step 10).** Y overlap is implied: hero and candy are both vertically centred in the same lane, and lane membership is already checked with an integer comparison. Testing Y would be redundant work in the hot loop. The hitbox is the hero inset by `HERO_HITBOX_PADDING` (18 px) on the X axis, taken from the design's collision math.

**Invulnerability** is a timestamp comparison, not a boolean plus a timer — `now >= invulnUntil`. No timer to cancel, no state to desynchronise, and it is naturally correct across resets. It lasts 1400 ms and drives four visible blinks.

### Bridges to React

Exactly three `runOnJS` calls exist, and each is rate-limited by construction:

| Call | Frequency |
|---|---|
| `applyFps` | once per second |
| `applyHit` | at most once per 1.4 s (invulnerability window) |
| `applyScore` | once per candy dodged |

---

## State — `src/store/gameStore.ts`

Zustand holds only what the UI renders:

```ts
GameState = { screen, who, lives, score, best, fps }
```

Hero position, candy positions, scroll offset and flicker phase are deliberately **not** here. Putting them in the store is the single easiest way to destroy the frame rate.

`hitHero` decrements lives; reaching 0 sets `screen: 'over'` and folds `score` into `best` in the same transition, so the record is captured without a separate effect. `reset` restores initial state but preserves `who` and `best` — the player's hero choice and record survive a new match.

**Zustand over Context:** Context re-renders every consumer on every change. Zustand's selector subscriptions mean only the components reading a given field re-render. `GameScreen` subscribes field by field for exactly this reason.

---

## Rendering — `src/render/` and `GameScreen`

The Skia tree is static in shape. It mounts, back to front:

1. `Tablecloth` — scrolling kitchen table, driven by `scrollX`
2. `LaneDividers` — dashed lane separators
3. `Foodie who="vilao"` — the villain, floating on a `useBob(12, 900)`
4. 8 `CandySlot` groups — position and opacity from shared values, spin shared
5. Hero group — shadow oval plus `Foodie who={who}`, opacity from `heroOpacity`

Skia reads shared values directly, so mutating one repaints without a React render. The node count never changes during play.

### Characters

`Foodie` dispatches on `who` to `Alface`, `Feijao`, `Arroz` or `Vilao`, and uniformly scales each to the requested pixel size from its design viewBox (heroes 120×150, villain 150×160). Geometry is ported verbatim from `docs/design/project/Foodie.dc.html` — that file is the source of truth, not the code.

`useWalkCycle` mirrors the design's CSS keyframes: legs swing ±16°, arms ±14° counter-phase, body bobs 3 px, all on a 320 ms half-cycle.

### Animation primitives — `src/render/anim.ts`

Three hooks, all returning a shared value driven by `withRepeat`:

| Hook | Motion |
|---|---|
| `useSwing(deg, ms)` | Ping-pong rotation, −deg to +deg |
| `useBob(px, ms)` | Ping-pong vertical translation |
| `useSpin(ms, dir)` | Continuous rotation, 0 to 2π |

These run on the UI thread independently of the frame loop. They are declarative and self-driving, so the worklet does not have to advance them.

### HUD

`Hud`, `GameOverModal` and the control hint are ordinary React Native views layered above the canvas, driven by Zustand. The FPS readout renders **only under `__DEV__`** — it is a development instrument, not part of the game.

---

## Theme — `src/theme/`

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `tokens.ts` | Colours, radii, spacing, Fredoka font families — the whole palette in one object |
| `ThemeContext.tsx` | `ThemeProvider` and `useTheme` |
| `useUiScale.ts` | Scales UI against viewport so the layout survives different screen heights |

`GAME_CONSTANTS.COLORS` is an alias for `theme.colors`, so gameplay and UI cannot drift apart. Colour literals should not appear in components.

---

## Input — `src/components/SwipeHandler.tsx`

Two `Gesture.Fling()` detectors — one for `Directions.UP`, one for `Directions.DOWN` — combined with `Gesture.Race`. Two gestures rather than one because Fling's `onEnd` payload does not carry the direction that triggered it.

`onEnd` is a worklet, so it hands the direction to JS via `runOnJS`. A 100 ms debounce on the JS side prevents one physical flick from registering twice.

`GameScreen` wraps `engine.moveLane` so the first lane change also dismisses the control hint. `moveLane` clamps to `[0, 2]`, ignores no-op moves, refuses to run on game over, and animates `heroY` with `withTiming` over 130 ms per the design.

**Trade-off:** Fling is a discrete gesture, so the hero cannot be dragged continuously between lanes. That matches the three-lane design and gives the cheapest possible input path.

---

## Tunable constants — `src/types/constants.ts`

| Constant | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `HERO_X_RATIO` | 0.09 | Hero's horizontal position as a fraction of width |
| `HERO_WIDTH` / `HERO_HEIGHT` | 96 / 120 | Hero size and hitbox basis |
| `HERO_HITBOX_PADDING` | 18 | X-axis inset; higher is more forgiving |
| `HERO_LANE_TRANSITION_DURATION` | 130 ms | Lane switch duration |
| `CANDY_SIZE` | 52 | Candy size and hitbox |
| `CANDY_BASE_SPEED` | 340 px/s | Starting speed |
| `CANDY_SPEED_RAMP_MAX` / `_RATE` | 260 / 0.006 | Ceiling and slope of the speed ramp |
| `SPAWN_INTERVAL` | 900 ms | Starting spawn interval |
| `SPAWN_INTERVAL_MIN` / `_RAMP_RATE` | 420 / 0.004 | Floor and slope of the interval ramp |
| `OBSTACLE_MAX_ACTIVE` | 8 | Pool size — the cheapest frame-rate lever |
| `INVULN_DURATION` | 1400 ms | Invulnerability and flicker length |
| `SCORE_PER_DODGE` | 10 | Points per dodged candy |

---

## Decisions, in short

| Decision | Reason | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Game loop in a UI-thread worklet | Removes React from the frame budget entirely | Logic must be worklet-safe; harder to unit test |
| Fixed candy pool | Zero per-frame allocation, no GC pauses | Spawns are dropped if the pool saturates |
| `opacity` for visibility | Avoids mount/unmount churn in the Skia tree | Hidden nodes still cost a draw call |
| Candy type derived from slot index | Avoids state for a per-slot constant | Type distribution is fixed, not random |
| One shared spin phase | One animation instead of eight | Candies cannot spin independently |
| Difficulty derived from the clock | Reset restores difficulty for free | Ramp cannot be adjusted mid-match |
| Zustand for discrete state only | Selector subscriptions, no tree-wide re-renders | Two sources of truth to keep straight |
| `GameScreen` mounted for `'game'` and `'over'` | Replay without remount; modal over a frozen scene | Screen state must gate the loop |
| AABB collision, X axis only | Cheapest test that is correct given lane checks | Assumes sprites centred in lanes |
| Timestamp-based invulnerability | No timers to cancel or desynchronise | Depends on the monotonic game clock |
| Geometry ported from the design HTML | Single source of truth for shapes | Changes must start in `docs/design/` |

## Where the frame rate goes

The POC measured 30–50 fps on mid-range ARM with a simpler scene. v0.0.1 draws considerably more — character geometry, a scrolling background, lane dividers, a floating villain — so it should be assumed slower until measured. **That measurement has not been taken; QA on ARM hardware is outstanding.**

The loop itself is O(8) with no allocation and is not the bottleneck. Cost is in the Skia render path.

Cheapest levers, in order:

1. Lower `OBSTACLE_MAX_ACTIVE` — directly removes draw calls
2. Raise `SPAWN_INTERVAL_MIN` — fewer simultaneous candies at high difficulty
3. Simplify `Tablecloth` — a full-screen scrolling layer repainted every frame
4. Reduce character path complexity in `src/render/foodie/characters/`

Background and analysis from the POC: [results.md](./results.md).
